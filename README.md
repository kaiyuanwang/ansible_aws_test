# ansible_aws_test
Build 1 control server and multiple slave servers in AWS for ansible test.

1. Manually build EC2 control and slave servers with bootstraps and scripts after init:
	control_bootstrap.txt
	slave_bootstrap.txt
	config_control.sh

2. Use AWS cloudformation to build 1 control and 2 slaves for ansible test. Can extend to more servers.
	ansible_test_aws.yaml
	Dependecies:
    1. S3 bucket with pem file, packages, applications
    2. IAM role for S3 access
    3. Security group for My IP access only
    4. Building of control server depends on successful built of slave servers
  Functions:
    1. build 1 control server and 2 slave servers with all application dependency packages 
    2. On control, install ansible, git, copy applicaiton packages from private s3 bucket
    3. Use pem file from private s3 bucket for passwordless connections between all servers. change to rsa pair for enhanced security later.
    4. Update contorl /etc/hosts with slave IPs
    5. Need to update security group to allow laptop ip access
    6. Use AWS cfn-init for cloudformation metadata control
    7. Control server building depends on slave servers. Automatically roll back if control built fails.
    8. Output server public IPs in cloudformation Output
