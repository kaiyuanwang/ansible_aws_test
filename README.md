# 1. AWS EC2 bootstraps
Manually build EC2 control and slave servers with bootstraps and scripts after init. Build one control server and multiple slave servers in AWS for ansible test.

	control_bootstrap.txt
	slave_bootstrap.txt
	config_control.sh

# 2. AWS Cloudformations
Use AWS cloudformation to build 1 control and multiple slaves for ansible test, docker and serverless platforms.

	cfn_ansible_test.yaml
	cfn_ansible_test_one_server.yaml
	cfn_docker_serverless_test.yaml
	
Dependecies:
		
	1. S3 bucket with pem file, packages, applications
	2. IAM role for S3 access
	3. Security group for My IP access only
	4. Building of control server depends on successful built of slave servers
		
Functions:
	
	1. build 1 control server and 2 slave servers with all application dependency packages 
	2. On control, install ansible, git, copy applicaiton packages from private s3 bucket
	3. Use pem file from private s3 bucket for passwordless connections between all servers. 
	change to rsa pair for enhanced security later.
	4. Update contorl /etc/hosts with slave IPs
	5. Need to update security group to allow laptop ip access
	6. Use AWS cfn-init for cloudformation metadata control
	7. Control server building depends on slave servers. Automatically roll back if control built fails.
	8. Output server public IPs in cloudformation Output

# 3. Boto3 management for AWS Cloudformation.
Create, describe and delete AWS CloudFormation Stackes using boto3.
		
	cfn_launch.py
	
Dependencies:

	pip install requests
	pip install boto3
	    IAM -> USERS -> Add user
	    aws configure -> access key + secret key
	    C:\Users\kwang1\.aws\credentials
		[default]
		aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
		aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
	pip install awscli
	pip install yaml
	pip install json
	
Functions:

	1. Create, describe and delete AWS CloudFormation Stackes using boto3.
	2. Provide local IP address to enable EC2 access to local laptop only. 
	3. When creating stacks, if not provided, stack name will be appended with current timestamp.
	4. Describe stack will generate Xshell access config file for stacks in "CREATE_COMPLETE" status.
	5. Describe stack will show stack information until "DELETE_COMPLETE".
	6. Delete stack will delete Xshell access config file of the stack.
	7. Serialize stack info data to cfn-StackInfo.json.
	8. Serialize stack parameters to cfn-parameters.json with local ip information.
	9. Xshell connect to control server when using describe.

# 4. Troposphere AWS template generator.
Python script to generate cloudformations templates for ansible, serverless, docker, rfb stack types

	cfn_generate.py
		
Dependencies:

	pip install troposphere

Fucntions:

	1. Create AWS cloudformation template using Troposphere
	2. Use pem file from private s3 bucket for passwordless connections between all servers.
	3. Support stack types of ansible, serverless, docker, rfb
	4. Support cloudformation elements of Version, Mapping, Description, 
	Parameter, SecrurityGroup, Instance, Metadata, Userdata, DependsOn etc.
